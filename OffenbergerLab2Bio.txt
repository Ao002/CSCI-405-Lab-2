The three strengths that I would bring to a software development team would be my willingness to learn, my ability to think through a problem, 
and my ability to work with a team. My willingness to learn allows me to learn new technologies or languages for a given project. My ability to 
think through a problem helps me to debug problems that arise in software development. My ability to work with a team makes working with a software 
development group much easier since I would be able to work with the other members of the team.

One strength that I would bring to a software engineering team is commitment. I believe in my ability to stay commited to a task until it has reached the point of being
finished. Another strength of mine would be collaboration. I am always open to others ideas and the way in which they would go about certain tasks. Lastly, I am responsible.
If there is a deadline to get something done, I will make sure that what needs done is done by the deadline.
